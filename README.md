# Premier League Scores

## Description

Android app made as a school project. The app uses the https://www.football-data.org/ API. 
It shows finished and live games with scores, scheduled games and standings. Top scorers page is not (yet) implemented.
To run you will need an Android device or an emulator. I used Android Studio and an emulator with Android 8.1 for development.
